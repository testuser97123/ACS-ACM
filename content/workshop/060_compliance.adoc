{rhacs} provide a broad approach to all the compliance standards. The idea is to have compliance build in and ready to go for DevSecOps. The {rhacs} platform currently offers six different standards to
scan against. The six are CIS Docker, CIS K8s, HIPPA, PCI, NIST 800-190 and NIST 800-53. Each one
of the standards can be drilled into for finer grain information. In addition, each standard’s results can
be exported for an evidence report. The platform has an API for this functionality making the exports
completely automatable. One added benefit of the compliance reports is that it can help enforce the
internal security policies.

Compliance dashboard are a good tool to highlight areas for improvement within the cluster. {rhacs} help with the understanding of the control and provide
guidance in a simple language. The guidance will help the administrators understand what the control
is looking for.
* By clicking on a compliance standard security personas can inspect individual controls.
* On demand scans can be performed using the Scan button on the top right of the page.
* After the data collection is complete, Central performs checks on the data to determine results.

So, The compliance reports gather information for configuration, industry standards, and best practices for container-based workloads running in OpenShift.
In many ways, the compliance features are aleready seen - because they’re tied to controls that we saw in Risk, in the Network Graph, and in Policies.
Each standard represents a series of controls, with guidance provided by {rhacs} on the specific OpenShift configuration or DevOps process required to meet that control.
