== {rhacs} overview  
{rhacs} is a container and Kubernetes security platform. It is designed to report vulnerabilities for images, analyze and monitor Kubernetes for configuration, deployment and API activity, analyze and monitor container activity on nodes, and take enforcement actions when necessary. {rhacs} operates in three distinct container lifecycle stages: build, deploy and runtime, and can be configured to monitor or enforce policies in each of the secured clusters across all of the lifecycles.

=== Architecture Overview

{rhacs} consists of five main components: central, scanner, sensor, collector and admission controller.
At a high level, {rhacs} components are deployed according to this general rule: one central and scanner per customer, one sensor and admission controller per cluster, and one collector per node. The component are generated top-down beginning with central, therefore the scanner and sensor bundles (sensor/collectr/admission controller) are specific to the respective central that they were
generated for. Sensor bundles are also unique per cluster, and a bundle cannot be deployed to multiple
clusters.

|Component
|Location
|Description

|Central
|One central for multiple clusters - can be centralized in a tools/ops management cluster, or can be located in any of the secured clusters.
|Users interact with {rhacs} via the user
interface or APIs on central. Central
also sends notifications for violations
and interacts with integrations.

|Scanner and
scanner-db
|One instance of
each deployed with
central.
|{rhacs}-developed image scanner.
Analyzes and reports vulnerabilities
for images. Scanner uses HPA to
scale the number of replicas based
on workload (default is 1-5 replicas
with HPA).

|Sensor
|One sensor per
cluster. Each of the
secured clusters will
have one sensor.
|Analyzes and monitors the
orchestrator in secured clusters.
Note: requires privileged mode for
sensor bundle upgrade functionality

|Collector
|One collector per
node. Every node in
each of the secured
clusters will have one
instance of collector.
|Analyzes and monitors container
activity on nodes. Collectors use
a probe to monitor network and
process activity for the containers
running on the node.
Collector will update the probe to
match the kernel version of the
node. Note: requires privileged
mode to monitor process and
network activity.

|admission
controller
|One instance per
cluster (multiple
replicas).
|ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
for enforcing policies at the
Deploy lifecycle stage and
Kubernetes API abuse.

The followings table describe the interaction between {rhacs} components :

[cols="4,4",options=header]
|===
|Component
|Interaction

|Central <--> scanner
|Bi-directional communications : Central requests image scans from scanner. Scanner updates its CVE database via central


|Collector <--> sensor
|Collectors send all of their events to the respective
sensor for the cluster. Unidirectional 
communication initiated by the collectors.

|Admission controller -> sensor
|Unidirectional  communication initiated by
the admission controller pods.

|Sensor -> central
|Unidirectional  communication initiated by
sensor:

 * Periodic polling for sensor bundle configuration updates

 * Events for observed activity from the sensor bundle for the secured cluster

NOTE: Consider deploying the sensors and admission controllers and to run on master nodes, to guarantee quality of service and to reduce the potential impact of running security components alongside
publicly accessible services.
